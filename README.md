to do dynamic contact planner:
- accelerate cutsom integrator by vectorizing outer for loop
- achieve minimization of distance between obstacle and contact point


# important lessons (for fools)
- remember to remove start/stop constraint if it is in an infeasible position 
- remember to include constraints for all derivatives between decision variables
- things that may be impossible to fulfill: cost function, not constraint!
